# Data Visualisation Projects
A repository specific to my data visualisation projects. These include the use of: Tableau, Python and R, focusing on different data sets displayed in a clean and visual way.

Project list is as follows:
  * [Terror Attacks Heatmap](#terror-attacks-heatmap) - _In Development!_

## Terror Attacks Heatmap
Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from Kaggle, that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). This data set contains over 180,000 Terrorist Attacks within a time period of: 1970 - 2017, excluding 1993. Using the dataset, I have created a worldwide heatmap to identify the main areas of attacks.
