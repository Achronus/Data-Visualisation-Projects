# Data Visualisation Projects
A repository specific to my data visualisation projects. These include the use of: Tableau, Python and R, focusing on different data sets displayed in a clean and visual way. This repository is split into three sections:

- [Tableau Projects](#tableau-projects)
- [Python Projects](#python-projects) - _Coming Soon!_
- [R Projects](#r-projects) - _Coming Soon!_


## Tableau Projects
All of my Tableau projects can be found on my Tableau profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan.partridge#!/) and the stories behind them can be found through the links in the project listing.

Project list is as follows:
  * [Annual Bonus Analysis](https://github.com/Achronus/Data-Visualisation-Projects/wiki/Annual-Bonus-Analysis)
  * [Terror Attacks Heatmap](#terror-attacks-heatmap) - _In Development!_


## Terror Attacks Heatmap
Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from Kaggle, that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). This data set contains over 180,000 Terrorist Attacks within a time period of: 1970 - 2017, excluding 1993. Using the dataset, I have created a worldwide heatmap to identify the main areas of attacks.
